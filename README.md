Venflow is a brand new and from the ground up written ORM which tries to provide an alternative to EF-Core and many other ORMs. It allows you to define Models and their relations with each other. Additionally it maps all queries on its own while still maintain great performance, with options for custom SQL.

## About

Lets face it, EF-Core is awesome, but it can be slow, really slow. However this library tries to overcome that by providing similar features while providing great performance.

How you can help? This can be done in numerous ways, over on the issue section, such as:

- Creating feature requests

- Reporting bugs

- Creating pull requests


### Collaboration

If you want to collaborate on this project more, than creating issues and PR's, feel free to contact me on any of the mentioned contacts at the bottom of the file.

## Installation

Currently Venflow is still in the Development stage of the Core components and therefore not yet available for download.

## Comparison

Once the first version of Venflow will be released, benchmarks and deeper comparison to it and other ORMs will be released as well.

### Acknowledgements

I also want to mention all the other great ORM's out there, build by awesome people, which helped with building Venflow in one way or another.
