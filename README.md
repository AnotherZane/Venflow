Venflow is a brand new and from the ground up written ORM which tries to provide an alternative to EF-Core and many other ORMs. It allows you to define Models and their relations with each other. Additionally it maps all queries on its own while still maintaining great performance, with options for custom SQL.

## About

Lets face it, EF-Core is awesome, but it can be slow, really slow. However this library tries to overcome that by providing similar features while maintaining great performance. Venflow comes with a very similar UX to Dapper and EF-Core, in order to keep the learning curve as low as possible. 

#### Features

- Simple change-tracking for update operations
- Autogenerated Inserts
- Autogenerated Deletes
- Autogenerated Query Materializer, Join Generator
- SQL Injection safe string Interpolated SQL
